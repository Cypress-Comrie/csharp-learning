# C# Learning Journey

fundamentals is basically the same from learning JS except the ReadLine tool is pretty cool
lets a user add an input to use

Comments are same as JS easy to remember that!

you can redeclare variables theyre all constant

maths works the same as JS

# console commands 

.ReadKey is for checking for any button press 

these are for changing the consoles colour
Console.BackgroundColor = ConsoleColor.Yellow;
Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Black; 
.clear() to whipe off all existing text
.beep() to make a beep sound lol 

first one would throw an error. you have to use a \ to display things that have commands assosiated with them 
Console.WriteLine(""");
Console.WriteLine("\""); 

String interp doesnt need `` its $"" very diffrent 
Console.WriteLine($"My favorite number is {myFavoriteNumber}.");
